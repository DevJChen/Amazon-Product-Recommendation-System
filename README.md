# Amazon Product Recommendation System Project

## Project Overview

This project aims to develop a recommendation system for Amazon, enhancing the shopping experience by suggesting products tailored to users' preferences. By analyzing past interactions and purchases on Amazon, the system personalizes recommendations, improving user satisfaction and driving sales.

## How the Recommendation System Works

Recommendation systems utilize various approaches to predict and suggest items. Our Amazon product recommendation system will incorporate a hybrid approach, combining the strengths of content-based and collaborative filtering methods.

### Content-Based Filtering

- **Description**: Recommends products similar to those a user has previously liked or purchased.
- **Implementation**: Uses profile vectors (representing user preferences) and item vectors (representing product features) to calculate similarity. Similarity metrics such as cosine similarity, Euclidean distance, or Pearsonâ€™s correlation are employed.

### Collaborative Filtering

- **Description**: Suggests items by identifying patterns among users with similar tastes. If two users have liked similar products, they're likely to appreciate each other's favorites.
- **Implementation**: Leverages user behavior data to recommend products, based on the premise that similar users prefer similar items.

### Hybrid Approach

- **Description**: Combines content-based and collaborative filtering to overcome the limitations of each method.
- **Strategies**: Includes merging predictions from both methods or integrating collaborative filtering features into a content-based model.

## Data Utilization

The system relies on two types of data for generating recommendations:

- **Explicit Feedback**: Direct input from users, such as ratings or likes, indicating clear preferences.
- **Implicit Feedback**: Indirect clues from user behavior, like browsing history, clicks, or purchase patterns.

## Goal

The goal of this project is to build a robust Amazon product recommendation system based on explicit feedback. By blending content-based and collaborative approaches, the system aims to deliver highly personalized and relevant product suggestions, enhancing the Amazon shopping experience.
